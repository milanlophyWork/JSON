        JSON is a great way to transmit and utilize data especially within javascript. It is a light-weight data-interchange format. It is an object which can be used to describe something.
        <p> It always starts and ends with curly brackets {}. Name and value is separated by a colon (:) bounded in double quotes.
        More than one pair is separated by comma (,).</p>

        <p>* Extented from JavaScript</p>
        <p>* Media type is application/ JSON</p>
        <p>* Extension is .json</p>

        How it looks ?

        <p>It's a key/name value pairs. Eg: {"name" : "value"}</p>
        <p>Objects are comma separated. Eg: {"name1" : "value", "name2" : "value", "name3" : "value"}</p>
        <p>Arrays have square brackets with values separated by comma. Eg: {"name" : [{"name" : "value"}, {"name" : "value"}] }</p>

        <h4>It allows us to structure and organize our data. It is an ideal data-interchange language.</h4>

        <p>Data Types in JSON value can be any of these:</p>

        Number -> {"name" : "10"}, String -> {"name" : "Milan"}, Boolean -> {"name" : "true"}, Array -> {"name" : [{"name1" : 1}, "hello", "world"]},
        Object -> {"name" : {"name1" : 1, "name2" : 1}}, Null -> {"name" : null}
